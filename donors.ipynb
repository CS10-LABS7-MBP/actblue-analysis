    "> - Where do the donors giving through ActBlue come from geographically? Any striking or interesting patterns, or zip codes that typically don’t contribute?\n",
    "> - Where is the money going? Are people giving to local candidates or are they giving to candidates around the country? Which campaigns/candidates/groups have done the best job tapping into this network?\n",
    "> - What’s the gender breakdown and how does it compare to the gender breakdown of itemized contributions? Is it different?\n",
    "> - Are these new donors?\n",
    "> - Can we tell if these are recurring contributions or one time contributions?\n",
    "> - Do the majority of these donors give repeatedly or are they one and done? How does that compare to itemized contributions? How “sticky” is this?\n"
